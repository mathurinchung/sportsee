## 1. Project

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 18.14**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

### 1.2 Launching the project

- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn dev` command will allow you to run the micro API.
- Go to http://localhost:4200 in your favorite Web browser

### 1.3 Environment Variables

To use the micro API with the user interface, you need to follow the following steps:

- Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Open the `.env` file and add the following line: `VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"`.  
  This sets the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to the URL of your micro API. If your micro API is running at a different URL, replace http://localhost:3000 with the appropriate URL.
- Save the .env file.
- Restart the server by pressing `h` then `r`.
